ðŸ”€ **ByteChef Tip: Conditional Workflow Branching**

Need your workflow to make decisions? ByteChef's conditional task dispatchers have you covered!

**Branch Task Dispatcher**: Works like a switch statement, evaluating an expression and selecting the matching case to execute. Perfect for workflows with multiple possible paths.

**Condition Task Dispatcher**: Implements if/else logic, executing one set of tasks if a condition is true and another if it's false.

The diagram shows an input leading to an expression evaluation, which then branches into multiple paths based on different cases. Each path contains different tasks, illustrating how workflows can take different routes based on data.]

Example use cases:
- Route approvals based on request amount
- Process different data formats with specialized handlers
- Implement business rules with complex decision trees

These powerful flow controls allow you to build workflows that adapt to your business logic! #ByteChef #WorkflowAutomation #ConditionalLogic

### Branch Task Dispatcher Diagram

Create a clean, modern diagram showing the Branch Task Dispatcher flow:

1. Start with an input node labeled "Input Data"
2. Connect to a diamond-shaped decision node labeled "Evaluate Expression"
3. From the decision node, draw three paths:
   - Path 1: Labeled "Case: amount > 1000" leading to a task node "Executive Approval"
   - Path 2: Labeled "Case: amount > 100" leading to a task node "Manager Approval"
   - Path 3: Labeled "Default Case" leading to a task node "Automatic Approval"

Use ByteChef's brand colors and include the ByteChef logo in the corner. The diagram should be clean, professional, and easy to understand at a glance.

### Style Guidelines
- Use a light background with dark text for readability
- Use distinct colors for different paths
- Include small icons to represent different types of tasks
- Keep the overall design simple and uncluttered
- Ensure text is large enough to be readable when the image is shared on social media
