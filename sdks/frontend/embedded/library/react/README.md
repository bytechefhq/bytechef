## Development

### Setting up Yalc for Local Development

[Yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) is a tool for local package development that simulates publishing a package without actually publishing to a registry.

#### Prerequisites

- Install Yalc globally: `npm install -g yalc`

#### Publishing the Library

- **One-time build and publish**:

    ```bash
    npm run yalc:publish
    ```

    This builds the library and publishes it to the local Yalc store.

- **Update after changes:**

    ```
    npm run yalc:push
    ```

    This rebuilds the library and pushes updates to all projects using it.

- **Add the package to your project:**
    ```
    yalc add @bytechef/embedded-react
    npm install
    ```
    This adds the package from your local Yalc store to the project.

#### Suggested workflow steps

1. In the Bytechef `DesktopSidebar` component initialize the dialog with `const {openDialog} = useConnectDialog({options})`
   a. `options` are described in `UseConnectDialogProps`
2. `cd ~/.../bytechef/sdks/frontend/embedded/library/react`
3. Run `npm run dev:yalc`
4. On change inside the `sdk/index.tsx` the Bytechef dev server needs to be restarted to see the changes
   a. This is because of Vite's caching

#### Troubleshooting

Most common error is the `Incompatible React versions`:

```
Uncaught Error: Incompatible React versions: The "react" and "react-dom" packages must have the exact same version. Instead got:
  - react:      19.2.0
  - react-dom:  19.1.1
```

To fix this run these commands in both `client/` and `sdks/.../react/` (make sure both client servers are not running):

```
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```
