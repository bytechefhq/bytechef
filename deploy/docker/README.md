## Self Host

The following subsections describe how you can get started with one of _your own_ instances of ByteChef.

### Prerequisites

Ensure `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed and available for starting containers:

-   Install Docker: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
-   Install Docker Compose: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You may verify the installation by running `docker --version` and `docker-compose --version`. The output should roughly be something like below:

```bash
$ docker --version
Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```
