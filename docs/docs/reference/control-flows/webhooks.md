ByteChef provide the ability to register HTTP webhooks to receive notifications for certain events.

Registering webhooks is done when creating the job. E.g.:

```
{
  "workflowId": "samples/hello.json",
  "inputs": {
    ...
  },
  "webhooks": [{
    "type": "job.status", 
    "url": "http://example.com",
    "retry": {   # optional configuration for retry attempts in case of webhook failure 
      "initialInterval":"3s" # default 2s
      "maxInterval":"10s" # default 30s
      "maxAttempts": 4 # default 5
      "multiplier": 2.5 # default 2.0
    }
  }]
}
```

`type` is the type of event you would like to be notified on and `url` is the URL that ByteChef would be calling when the event occurs.

Supported types are `job.status` and `task.started`.
