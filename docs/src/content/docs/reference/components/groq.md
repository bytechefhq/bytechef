#### Properties

|      Name      |     Type     |     Control Type     |     Description     |
|:--------------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Model | STRING | TEXT  |  ID of the model to use.  |
| Messages | [{STRING\(content), STRING\(role)}] | ARRAY_BUILDER  |  A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.  |
| Response Format | INTEGER | SELECT  |  In which format do you want the response to be in?  |
| Response Schema | STRING | TEXT_AREA  |  Define the JSON schema for the response.  |
| Max Tokens | INTEGER | INTEGER  |  The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.  |
| Number of Chat Completion Choices | INTEGER | INTEGER  |  How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.  |
| Temperature | NUMBER | NUMBER  |  Controls randomness:  Higher values will make the output more random, while lower values like will make it more focused and deterministic.  |
| Top P | NUMBER | NUMBER  |  An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling,  where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  |
| Frequency Penalty | NUMBER | NUMBER  |  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.  |
| Presence Penalty | NUMBER | NUMBER  |  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.  |
| Logit Bias | {} | OBJECT_BUILDER  |  Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.  |
| Stop | [STRING] | ARRAY_BUILDER  |  Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.  |
| Functions | [STRING] | ARRAY_BUILDER  |  Enter the names of functions you want to use.  |
| User | STRING | TEXT  |  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help admins to monitor and detect abuse.  |
