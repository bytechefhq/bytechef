|:--------------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Model | STRING | TEXT  |  The model to use for image generation.  |
| Messages | [{STRING\(content), NUMBER\(weight)}] | ARRAY_BUILDER  |  A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.  |
| Height | INTEGER | INTEGER  |  Height of the image to generate, in pixels, in an increment divisible by 64. Engine-specific dimension validation applies.  |
| Width | INTEGER | INTEGER  |  Width of the image to generate, in pixels, in an increment divisible by 64. Engine-specific dimension validation applies.  |
| Number of responses | INTEGER | INTEGER  |  The number of images to be generated. Must be between 1 and 10.  |
| Response format | STRING | SELECT  |  The format in which the generated images are returned.  |
| Style | STRING | SELECT  |  Pass in a style preset to guide the image model towards a particular style. This list of style presets is subject to change.  |
| Steps | INTEGER | INTEGER  |  Number of diffusion steps to run. Valid range: 10 to 50.  |
| CFG scale | NUMBER | NUMBER  |  The strictness level of the diffusion process adherence to the prompt text. Range: 0 to 35.  |
| Clip guidance preset | STRING | TEXT  |  Pass in a style preset to guide the image model towards a particular style. This list of style presets is subject to change.  |
| Sampler | STRING | TEXT  |  Which sampler to use for the diffusion process. If this value is omitted, an appropriate sampler will be automatically selected.  |
| Seed | NUMBER | NUMBER  |  Random noise seed (omit this option or use 0 for a random seed). Valid range: 0 to 4294967295.  |
