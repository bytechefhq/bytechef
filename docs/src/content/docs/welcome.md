ByteChef is an open-source, low-code, extendable API integration and workflow automation platform. It automates daily routines that require interaction between independent business applications. ByteChef maintains automation definitions in easy-to-understand workflow like format. anl-readme-md

## Why ByteChef?

Due to increasing number of various applications and services used inside organizations, engineering teams are under constant pressure to develop new integrations and workflows to automate work inside those organizations.
ByteChef has the necessary infrastructure and features to integrate various applications and services and build workflows across organization:

1. Install ByteChef on the premise to have a full control over execution and data, besides being able to use a hosted version.
2. Define workflows via the UI editor by drag-and-dropping connectors and defining their relations, thus empowering your citizen developers. If you need to go beyond no-code workflow definition, your developers can leverage our low-code capabilities and write custom functions as part of your workflows, or extend ByteChef by developing custom connectors.
3. A more extensive range of various flow controls that can be used in the workflow like if, switch, loop, each, parallel, etc. Also, new conditionals can be added.
4. Develop custom connectors in four languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
5. Write custom functions(executed during the workflow execution when you need to write the code) in the languages mentioned above.
6. All languages are executed inside ONE runtime(no need for various execution runtimes for each language), simplifying scalability. You can start with one instance only, scale as required, and at the same time mix languages for your customizations.

ByteChef can help you as:

1. Automation solution, which allows customers to integrate applications used internally to automate their own business processes.
2. Embedded solution targeted explicitly for products which allow your customers to integrate applications they use with your product.
