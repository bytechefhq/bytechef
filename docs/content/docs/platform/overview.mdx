ByteChef is an open-source, enterprise-ready platform for API integration and workflow automation designed to help teams streamline and automate routine processes across independent business applications.

## What is ByteChef?

ByteChef enables teams to streamline and automate routine processes that span across independent business applications. With a visual, workflow-based approach, ByteChef makes it easy to define, manage, and scale automation; even for complex integrations.

Built with flexibility in mind, ByteChef supports the creation of AI-powered agents and intelligent workflows, allowing organizations to automate decision-making, trigger contextual actions, and build dynamic systems that adapt to real-world business needs.

Whether you're a developer creating custom connectors or a business user configuring workflows through the drag-and-drop editor, ByteChef provides the tools to automate and integrate efficiently—on-premise or in the cloud.

## Architecture Overview

ByteChef is designed with modularity, scalability, and extensibility in mind, making it suitable for both small teams and enterprise-scale deployments. Its architecture is composed of several key components:

### Workflow Engine
At the core of ByteChef is the workflow engine, responsible for executing automation logic. Workflows are defined as sequences of steps using flow control constructs such as if, loop, parallel, and switch, and can include custom logic and external service calls.

### Visual Workflow Builder
The drag-and-drop UI builder enables users to visually design workflows by combining connectors and logic blocks. This empowers non-technical users (citizen developers) to create and modify workflows easily.

### AI Agent Integration
ByteChef supports the creation of AI-driven agents that can interact with workflows, perform contextual reasoning, and automate intelligent responses. These agents can be embedded directly into workflows or triggered by external events, enabling dynamic decision-making and adaptive behavior.

### Connector Framework
ByteChef integrates with external systems using connectors. It includes built-in connectors for popular services and allows developers to build custom connectors in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby.

### Custom Functions
ByteChef allows you to leverage low-code capabilities by writing custom functions in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby. These functions can be embedded within workflows to perform dynamic, logic-driven operations during execution.

### Deployment Options
ByteChef supports flexible deployment models:

- **On-Premise**: For organizations requiring full control over infrastructure and data.
- **Hosted (Cloud)**: For fast, scalable, and maintenance-free deployments.

### Monitoring and Logging
Built-in observability tools provide visibility into workflow execution, logs, and errors, allowing teams to monitor performance, diagnose issues, and optimize automation flows.
