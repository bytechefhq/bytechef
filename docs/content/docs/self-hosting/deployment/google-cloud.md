__Google Cloud Platform (GCP)__ is a self-hosted instance for running ByteChef in cloud-hosted self-managed environments. It provides scalable compute capacity, reliable infrastructure, and flexible deployment options while maintaining full control over your ByteChef instance.

Just like other instances, ByteChef also supports deployment on GCP using __Docker__ and __Docker Compose__. This guide covers Compute Engine instance setup, security configuration, and ByteChef deployment steps.
