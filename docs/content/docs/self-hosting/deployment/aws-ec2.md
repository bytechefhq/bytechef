__AWS EC2__ is a self-hosted instance for running ByteChef in cloud-hosted self-managed environments. It provides scalable compute capacity, reliable infrastructure, and flexible deployment options while maintaining full control over your ByteChef instance.

ByteChef supports deployment on EC2 using the [Docker](/self-hosting/deployment/local-docker) self-hosted instance. This guide covers EC2 instance setup, security configuration, and ByteChef deployment steps.
