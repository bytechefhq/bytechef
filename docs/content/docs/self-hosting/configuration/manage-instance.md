In this section, we will explore the self-hosted ByteChef instance management credentials, for configuring and monitoring your self-hosted ByteChef deployment instance.

## Deployment Information

The deployment type shows whether you're running on Docker, Kubernetes, or another platform. This helps you identify which commands and configuration methods apply to your setup.

The version number indicates which ByteChef release you have installed - it's important when checking for updates or troubleshooting issues.

Database connectivity status shows whether ByteChef can reach your PostgreSQL database. A good connection with databases is needed for all operations.

## Observability

ByteChef provides comprehensive observability features for monitoring your instance through metrics, logs, and distributed traces. With the proper configuration, you gain insight into system performance, application behavior, and request flows across components.
