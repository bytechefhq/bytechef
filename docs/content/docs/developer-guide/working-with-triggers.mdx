## If You Are Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open Bytechef Codebase:
    - Navigate to bytechef/server/apps/server-app/src/main/resources/config.
2. Create Local Configuration:
    - Create a file named `application-local.yml`.
    - Note: `application-local.yml` is optional, git-ignored, and corresponds to the `local` Spring profile. Ensure the `local` profile is activated on Spring Boot startup.
3. Configure Webhook URL:
    - Add the following configuration to `application-local.yml`, replacing `(first address under Forwarding)` with the copied ngrok URL:
   ```
   bytechef:
         webhook-url: (first address under Forwarding)/webhooks/{id}
     ```
4. Activate Local Profile:

    - Ensure that the `local` profile is added to active profiles in your IntelliJ configuration.

    ```
3. Start the ByteChef application.

**Note:** Docker has to be restarted in order to update any changes made to `BYTECHEF_HOME/server/local.env` file.
