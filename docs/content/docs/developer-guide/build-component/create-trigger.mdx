title: Create Trigger
---

Triggers are the starting points for workflows in ByteChef. They initiate workflow execution based on specific events or conditions.

## Trigger Types

- **Webhook Triggers**: Trigger workflows via HTTP requests
- **Scheduled Triggers**: Run workflows at specific times or intervals
- **Polling Triggers**: Check external services for new data
- **Event Triggers**: Respond to specific events in connected systems

## Creating a Trigger

1. Define the trigger configuration
2. Implement the trigger logic
3. Handle incoming data
4. Test your trigger

For detailed examples and best practices, refer to the component development documentation.
