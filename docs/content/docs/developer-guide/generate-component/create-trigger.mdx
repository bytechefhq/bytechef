In `server/libs/modules/components/newcomponent/src/main/java/com/bytechef/component/newcomponent/trigger` package, the `NewComponentDummyTrigger` class defines the trigger. The `TRIGGER_DEFINITION` constant contains all the details about the trigger, including its name, title, description, properties and others.

```java
public static final ModifiableTriggerDefinition TRIGGER_DEFINITION = action("dummy")
    .title("Dummy Trigger")
    .description("Trigger description.")
    .properties()
    .output(
        outputSchema(
            string()));
```

For more information about any method in the `TRIGGER_DEFINITION`, refer to the [trigger documentation](/reference/triggers).
