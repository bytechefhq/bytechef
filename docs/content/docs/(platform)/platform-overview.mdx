## What is ByteChef?

It enables teams to streamline and automate routine processes that span across independent business applications. With a visual, workflow-based approach, ByteChef makes it easy to define, manage, and scale automation—even for complex integrations.

Built with flexibility in mind, ByteChef supports the creation of AI-powered agents and intelligent workflows, allowing organizations to automate decision-making, trigger contextual actions, and build dynamic systems that adapt to real-world business needs.

Whether you’re a developer creating custom connectors or a business user configuring workflows through the drag-and-drop editor, ByteChef provides the tools to automate and integrate efficiently—on-premise or in the cloud.

## Architecture Overview

ByteChef is designed with modularity, scalability, and extensibility in mind, making it suitable for both small teams and enterprise-scale deployments. Its architecture is composed of several key components:

1. Workflow Engine

At the core of ByteChef is the workflow engine, responsible for executing automation logic. Workflows are defined as sequences of steps using flow control constructs such as if, loop, parallel, and switch, and can include custom logic and external service calls.

2. Visual Workflow Builder

The drag-and-drop UI builder enables users to visually design workflows by combining connectors and logic blocks. This empowers non-technical users (citizen developers) to create and modify workflows easily.

3. AI Agent Integration

ByteChef supports the creation of AI-driven agents that can interact with workflows, perform contextual reasoning, and automate intelligent responses. These agents can be embedded directly into workflows or triggered by external events.  This enables dynamic decision-making and adaptive behavior as part of your process logic.

4. Connector Framework

ByteChef integrates with external systems using connectors. It includes built-in connectors for popular services and allows developers to build custom connectors in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby. These connectors define how ByteChef communicates with APIs or services.

5. Custom Functions

In addition to connectors, ByteChef allows you to leverage our low-code capabilities by writing custom functions in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby. These functions can be embedded within workflows to perform dynamic, logic-driven operations during execution, giving developers full flexibility to handle complex automation scenarios.

6. Unified Runtime Environment

Custom functions and connectors are executed in a single, unified runtime that supports multiple programming languages. This avoids the complexity of managing separate environments and allows seamless mixing of languages in workflows.

7. Deployment Options

ByteChef supports flexible deployment models:

  - On-Premise: For organizations requiring full control over infrastructure and data.
  - Hosted (Cloud): For fast, scalable, and maintenance-free deployments.

8. Monitoring and Logging

Built-in observability tools provide visibility into workflow execution, logs, and errors. This allows teams to monitor performance, diagnose issues, and optimize automation flows.

## ByteChef can help you as:

1. Automation solution, which allows customers to integrate applications used internally to automate their own business processes.
2. Embedded solution targeted explicitly for products which allow your customers to integrate applications they use with your product.
