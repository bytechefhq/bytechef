title: Loop
---

The Loop flow control repeats a set of actions either for each item in a list or continuously until stopped. This flow control is great for processing large amounts of data that can be processed in batches, or used for creating retry logic.

**Type**: `loop/v1`

## Properties

|      Name       |      Label     |     Type     |     Description     | Required |
|:---------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:-------------------:|:--------:|
| items | List of items | ARRAY <details> <summary> Items </summary> [] </details> | List of items to iterate over. | false |
| loopForever | Loop Forever | BOOLEAN <details> <summary> Options </summary> <span>true</span>, <span>true</span> </details> | Should loop iterate until condition set by 'Loop Break' statement is met. | false |

## Usage

To use the Loop flow control, follow these steps in the workflow UI editor:

### Step 1: Add Loop to Your Workflow
1. Select the **Loop** component from the **Flows** component panel
2. Add it at the point where you need repeated execution


### Step 2: Choose Loop Mode

**Option A: Loop Forever (Continuous Execution)**
1. In the **Properties** tab, set **Loop Forever** to `true`
2. No expression needed - the loop runs continuously

**Option B: Iterate Over List (Collection Processing)**
1. In the **Properties** tab, set **Loop Forever** to `false`
2. In the **List of Items to Iterate Over** field, select your data source based on your available data pills:
   - Example: `${googleSheets_1.rows}` to iterate over spreadsheet rows
   - Example: `${salesforce_1.accounts}` to process account records
   - Example: `${webhook_1.orders}` to handle multiple orders


### Step 3: Add Components Inside the Loop
1. Click the **+** button inside the loop body
2. Add the components you want to execute repeatedly
3. When iterating over a list, reference the current item using `${item}`
   - Access item properties via data pills based on configuration: `${item.email}`, `${item.status}`, etc.

> **Warning**
> 
> When `loopForever` is set to `true`, ensure your workflow has proper exit logic to avoid infinite execution. Without completion conditions, the loop will continue indefinitely and may consume resources or exceed execution time limits.
