| maxTokens | Max Tokens | INTEGER | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. | false |
| temperature | Temperature | NUMBER | Controls randomness:  Higher values will make the output more random, while lower values like will make it more focused and deterministic. | false |
| topP | Top P | NUMBER | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling,  where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. | false |
