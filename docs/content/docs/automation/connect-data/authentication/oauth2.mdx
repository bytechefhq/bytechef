# OAuth 2.0 Authentication

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. It allows ByteChef to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Google, GitHub, or Salesforce, without requiring your password.

## How it Works

1. **Authorization Request**: When you create a new connection, ByteChef redirects you to the service provider (e.g., Google).
2. **User Authorization**: You log in to the service provider and grant ByteChef permission to access your data.
3. **Authorization Grant**: The service provider redirects you back to ByteChef with an authorization code.
4. **Access Token**: ByteChef exchanges the authorization code for an access token, which is used to make API calls on your behalf.

## Setting Up OAuth 2.0 Connections

To set up an OAuth 2.0 connection in ByteChef:

1. Go to the **Connections** tab.
2. Click **New Connection** and select a service that uses OAuth 2.0.
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret from the service provider's developer portal.
4. Click **Next** to continue setting up the connection.
5. Select scopes for the connection and click **Connect**.
6. You will be redirected to the service's login page.
7. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow** or **Authorize**.
8. Once redirected back to ByteChef, your connection is ready to use.

## Security

ByteChef securely stores access tokens and refresh tokens. Credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption, ensuring your data remains private and secure.
