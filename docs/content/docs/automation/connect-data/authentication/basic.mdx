# Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. It uses a username and a password to authenticate requests.

## How it Works

When using Basic Authentication, ByteChef combines your username and password, encodes them using Base64, and includes them in the `Authorization` header of every HTTP request.

Example header:
`Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==`

## Setting Up Basic Auth Connections

To set up a Basic Authentication connection in ByteChef:

1. Go to the **Connections** tab.
2. Click **New Connection** and select a service that uses Basic Auth.
3. Enter your **Username** (sometimes an email address or an API token).
4. Enter your **Password** or **Secret**.
5. Click **Save** to create the connection.

## Security

While Basic Authentication is simple, it should always be used over HTTPS to ensure that your credentials are not transmitted in plain text. ByteChef stores your credentials securely using AES-256 encryption at rest.
