API Key authentication is a simple way to authenticate with many third-party services. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API.

## How it Works

When you use an API key, ByteChef includes the key in the header or as a query parameter in every request made to the service's API.

Example header:
`X-API-Key: abcdef12345`

Example query parameter:
`?api_key=abcdef12345`

## Finding Your API Key

API keys are usually found in the settings or developer dashboard of the service you want to connect to. Look for sections named:
- API Settings
- Developer Tools
- Security
- Integrations

## Setting Up API Key Connections

To set up an API key connection in ByteChef:

1. Go to the **Connections** tab.
2. Click **New Connection** and select a service that uses API Keys.
3. Enter your API Key in the provided field.
4. Some services may also require an **API Secret** or an **App ID**.
5. Click **Save** to create the connection.

## Security

API keys should be treated with the same level of security as passwords. ByteChef encrypts all stored API keys using AES-256 at rest to ensure they are protected.
