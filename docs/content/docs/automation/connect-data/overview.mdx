ByteChef's Connect Data feature allows you to seamlessly integrate with hundreds of third-party applications and services. This section will guide you through managing these connections to power your automations.

## What are Connections?

Connections in ByteChef are secure links between your ByteChef account and external services. They store authentication details and configuration needed to interact with these services through your workflows.

Think of a connection as a bridge: one end is in ByteChef, and the other is in your favorite app (like Slack, Google Drive, or Salesforce). Once this bridge is built, ByteChef can safely walk across it to send or retrieve data.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Management**: View, edit, and monitor all your connections in one place.
- **Reusable**: Create a connection once and use it across dozens of different workflows.
- **Secure**: All credentials are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Easy Setup**: Guided wizards help you navigate the authentication process for each service.
