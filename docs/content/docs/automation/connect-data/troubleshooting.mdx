## OAuth 2.0 Issues

### *Redirect URI Mismatch*
This error usually occurs when the Redirect URI configured in the third-party application (e.g., Google Cloud Console, GitHub Developer Settings) doesn't match the one ByteChef is using.
- **Solution**: Ensure the Redirect URI in your service provider's settings is exactly `https://your-bytechef-instance.com/callback`.

### *Access Denied* or *Invalid Permissions*
This happens when the user doesn't have sufficient permissions to authorize ByteChef or when the requested scopes are not allowed by the service provider.
- **Solution**: Check that your account has the necessary administrative rights and that the required scopes are enabled in the service provider's application settings.

## API Key, Bearer and Basic Auth Issues

### *Unauthorized* or 401 Errors
This usually means the API key, token, username, or password is incorrect.
- **Solution**: Double-check your credentials and ensure they are active. Some API keys or tokens might have expiration dates or restricted permissions.

### *Forbidden* or 403 Errors
The credentials are correct, but the account doesn't have permission to perform the requested action.
- **Solution**: Verify that your API key, token, or account has the necessary permissions (scopes) for the specific operation you're trying to perform in your workflow.

## General Connection Issues

### Connection Timeouts
ByteChef may time out if the third-party service is slow to respond.
- **Solution**: Check the service provider's status page to see if they are experiencing any downtime.
