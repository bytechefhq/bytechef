## What is ByteChef Automation?

ByteChef Automation allows you to easily build and run smart workflows that connect your apps, automate routine tasks,
and include AI-driven decisions—all without heavy coding. This guide will help you understand the basics and get started
with creating your first workflow.

It enables you to:

- Connect different applications and services together
- Automate repetitive tasks and business processes
- Create workflows with conditional logic and data transformations
- Integrate AI capabilities into your automation processes
- Build complex integrations with a visual, no-code interface
