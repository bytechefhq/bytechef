/**
 * Event listener that triggers actions after an MCP server is saved. Specifically, it is responsible for managing
 * project deployment triggers based on the state of the saved MCP server entity.
 *
 * This class extends the generic {@link AbstractRelationalEventListener}, allowing it to listen to and process
 * {@link AfterSaveEvent} events for entities of type {@link McpServer}.
 *
 * The primary function of this listener is to enable or disable associated project deployments based on the saved MCP
 * server's properties.
