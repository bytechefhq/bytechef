## Connection Setup

Follow these steps to connect Jira Cloud to ByteChef using OAuth 2.0.

1. Open the Atlassian Developer Console: https://developer.atlassian.com/console/
2. Sign in with your Atlassian account (create one if needed).
3. Click **Create** and choose **OAuth 2.0 integration**.
4. Enter the app details (e.g., App name: "ByteChef Jira Integration") and accept Atlassian's developer terms, then click **Create**.

5. Configure permissions (scopes):
   - In the Permissions tab, add the following scopes required by ByteChef Jira component:
     - manage:jira-webhook
     - read:jira-work
     - write:jira-work
     - read:jira-user
   - You can adjust scopes later if your workflows need more/less access.

6. Configure a redirect (callback) URL:
   - Go to the **Authorization** tab and add the Callback URL:
        - `https://app.bytechef.io/callback` (Cloud)
        - `http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback` (Local dev)

7. Retrieve credentials:
   - Open the **Settings** page of your app and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

Notes:

- Jira Cloud only: This connection uses Atlassian Cloud APIs. After consent, ByteChef automatically discovers the correct Jira site base URL.
