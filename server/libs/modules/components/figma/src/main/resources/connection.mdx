## Connection Setup

### Create a Figma OAuth App

1. Go to https://www.figma.com/developers/apps (or click “My Apps” in the top toolbar).
2. Click **Create a new app** (top-right).
3. Enter a name for your OAuth app and select a Team/Organization. The app must be associated with a team or organization.
4. Click **Create**.
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and store them securely.
   - Figma shows the Client Secret only once. You’ll need it for token exchange and refreshing access tokens.

### Configure OAuth Scopes

On the OAuth scopes page, select the scopes your app needs. For the ByteChef Figma connector, enable:

- `file_comments:read`
- `file_comments:write`
- `webhooks:write`

### Set the Redirect URI

Add the ByteChef OAuth2 callback URL as a Redirect URI in your Figma app:

- Example cloud URL: `https://app.bytechef.io/callback`
- Example local URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback`

If you run ByteChef with a custom domain, the pattern is: `<YOUR_PUBLIC_URL>/callback`.
