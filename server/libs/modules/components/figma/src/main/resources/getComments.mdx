#### Find File Key

To find a Figma file key, copy the alphanumeric string located between `/file/` (or `/design/`, `/proto/`, etc.) and the file name in the browser URL. For example, in `https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123456/File-Name`, the file key is `ABC123456`. You can also right-click a file in the desktop app and select **Copy link** to extract it.
