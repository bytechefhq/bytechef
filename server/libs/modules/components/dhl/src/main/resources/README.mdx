### How to find your tracking number

A tracking number or ID is a combination of numbers and possibly letters that uniquely identifies your shipment for national or international tracking.

Usually, the shipper or online shop is able to provide the tracking number or ID. If you have ordered a product in an online shop, the confirmation email or shipment tracking notification often contains the tracking number or ID.
