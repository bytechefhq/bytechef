To find a Google Presentation ID, open the presentation in edit mode and look at the URL in your browser's address bar. The ID is the long string of letters, numbers, and hyphens located between /d/ and /edit. Example: `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p`.
