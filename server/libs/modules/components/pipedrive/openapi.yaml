      summary: Get all leads
      description: |
        Returns multiple leads. Leads are sorted by the time they were created, from oldest to newest. Pagination can be controlled using `limit` and `start` query parameters. If a lead contains custom fields, the fields' values will be included in the response in the same format as with the `Deals` endpoints. If a custom field's value hasn't been set for the lead, it won't appear in the response. Please note that leads do not have a separate set of custom fields, instead they inherit the custom fields' structure from deals.

      summary: Add a lead
      description: 'Creates a lead. A lead always has to be linked to a person or an organization or both. All leads created through the Pipedrive API will have a lead source `API` assigned. Here''s the tutorial for <a href="https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/adding-a-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding a lead</a>. If a lead contains custom fields, the fields'' values will be included in the response in the same format as with the `Deals` endpoints. If a custom field''s value hasn''t been set for the lead, it won''t appear in the response. Please note that leads do not have a separate set of custom fields, instead they inherit the custom fields'' structure from deals. See an example given in the <a href="https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/updating-custom-field-value" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating custom fields'' values tutorial</a>.'
