## Connection Setup

Follow these steps to generate a Dev.to API Key and configure the ByteChef connection.

Prerequisites:
- You have an active account at [dev.to](https://dev.to/)

Steps to generate an API Key on Dev.to:
1. Log in to your [dev.to](https://dev.to/) account.
2. Open Settings: click your avatar (top‑right) → Settings, or go directly to [https://dev.to/settings](https://dev.to/settings).
3. In the left sidebar, select **Extensions**, or go directly to [https://dev.to/settings/extensions](https://dev.to/settings/extensions).
4. Scroll to the section **DEV Community API Keys**.
5. Enter a description/name for the key and click **Generate API Key**.
6. A dropdown will appear under the button. Expand it to reveal your new API key.
7. Copy the API key and store it securely. You can revoke it at any time from the same page.

Configure the ByteChef Dev.to connection:
1. In ByteChef, create a new Dev.to connection.
2. Paste the API key into the "API Key" field.
3. Save the connection. ByteChef will use this key by sending it in the `api-key` HTTP header to `https://dev.to/api`.

Notes and troubleshooting:
- Treat the API key like a password. Do not share it or commit it to source control.
- If you receive 401 Unauthorized errors, verify that the key is correct and has not been revoked.
- You can create multiple keys (e.g., for different environments) and revoke them individually.
