## Connection Setup

Follow these steps to connect Accelo to ByteChef using OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code):

1. Determine your Accelo deployment (subdomain)
   - Your deployment is the subdomain you use to access Accelo.
   - Example: if you sign in at `https://acme.api.accelo.com`, your deployment is `acme`.

2. Register an app in Accelo
   - In Accelo, go to: Configuration → API → Register Application.
   - Choose the application type: Web Application (required for OAuth2 Authorization Code).
   - Give it a name (e.g., **ByteChef Accelo Integration**).

3. Configure the redirect (callback) URL
   - Add the ByteChef OAuth callback URL to your app:
     - `https://app.bytechef.io/callback` (Cloud)
     - `http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback` (Local development)

4. Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret from your Accelo app.
